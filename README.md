# Todos app

My first application using vue.js as a recruitment task. 

In order to run application, you must install all dependencies first:

`npm install`

then

`npm run dev` --> development mode, server that runs on 8080 with hot updates

or

`npm run build` --> builds the app into build folder. 

or 

`npm run test` --> run e2e tests using chimp
